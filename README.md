## How to set up the ProjectÂ¶

You only need to get the project code and install the dependencies with Composer.  
And follow this command:
https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html#setting-up-an-existing-symfony-project  

Then run those two commands:
```
composer install  
yarn install
yarn encore dev

```
Copy the .env in .env.local

```

```
